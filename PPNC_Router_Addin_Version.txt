-070915 v0.30
	-released with NC HMI v0.9p (6/11/15)  Internal-bba2336   MCF 1.7.5655
	-changes for Sting Ray to get new features and changes made to HMI
	-Rapid display changes

	-fix for "mystery message" popping up when Axes Display mode changed
	e.g.  "Axes Display has been changed from Relative Position to Machine Position"
		-this is fixed by commenting out lines in function "AxesDisplay_ChangedAsString()" in
		Project CustomExamples - CustomObject.cs file  &   PageCustom.xaml
		-it is to demo how main HMI can link and make calls to custom projects in this case when the
			Axes display changes this gets called
		-we here comment out to prevent this message from coming up in our production HMI on router
		-It is in 2 PLACES to Comment OUT !

		File PageCustom.xaml
		private void AxesDisplay_ChangedAsString(FMember member, MemberChangedEventArgs<string> e)
        {
            //tbAxesDisplay.Text = e.NewValue;
        }

		CustomObject.cs
		private void AxesDisplay_ChangedAsString(FMember member, MemberChangedEventArgs<string> e)
        {
            //if (e.NewValue != e.OldValue)
            //    g.Report(this, EReportType.InformationAlarm, "Axes Display has been changed from {0} to {1}.", e.OldValue, e.NewValue);
        }

	-resolve conflict with new HMI version, it is using M41 and so is Router Addin
		-it is using .M41 for "Gear Range M-code group"
		-edit the PowerPmacNC project file "MCodes.cs" to comment out "public enum EGearRangeGroup" section and
			comment out ref to .M41 in "public MCodes(FObject Owner, FDevice Controller)" functions
