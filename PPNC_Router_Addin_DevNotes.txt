PPNC_Router_Addin_DevNotes.txt
02/28/15

*** How this works:
	-when NC14 HMI starts if INI has in section [External Assemblies] instructions
	to load this addin it will
	-need to create a sub-dir (NOT PUT FILES in SAME DIR AS HMI) for these files
	-only files needed in the sub-dir (\PPNC_Router_Addin) are "DeviceMembers.xml"  and  "PPNC_Router_Addin.dll"
		-may also have the PPNC_Router_Addin.pdb here if debugging but for release not used

*** 6/12/16  Dev notes to create a new Add-In version from latest PowerNC build

	- get latest NC16 build from git repo
		- change Build - Configuration mgr - top lines in dialog should be [Debug]  [x86]
			- not need to change project items in list box just top line in dialog

		- open and edit to remove the .M41 reference which conflicts with Router Add-in
			-resolve conflict with new HMI version, it is using M41 and so is Router Addin
				-it is using .M41 for "Gear Range M-code group"
				-edit the PowerPmacNC project file "MCodes.cs" to comment out "public enum EGearRangeGroup" section and
					comment out ref to .M41 in "public MCodes(FObject Owner, FDevice Controller)" functions

	- now rebuild and should have new files in \debug
				\PowerPmacNC\bin\Debug\MCFoundation.dll
				\PowerPmacNC\bin\Debug\PowerPmacNC.exe
		-copy these to Add-In dir (overwrite existing)
			C:\VS_2013\PPNC_Router_Addin\PPNC_Router_Addin\References

	- now copy new set of Master files for NC16 to your test dir
		- this is the base set of NC16 HMI files to run new version, we will now put in Add-In files
		C:\4_PowerNC-Demo\PPNC16_HMI_Router

	- open the Add-In project in VS
		- change the version number
			-update version number in:
			PageCustomTab1.xaml.cs file       ttbVersion.Text = "PPNC_Router_Addin v0.30";
				- NOT need to edit this: upper left text box in "PageCustomTab1.xaml"

	- edit the version.txt file with new details and version numbers

	- delete in References the MCFoundation and PowerPmacNC items
	- now Add the References back in from new files copied to C:\VS_2013\PPNC_Router_Addin\PPNC_Router_Addin\References
		-not sure if this is needed since same file names used ?  I think not ?

	- now rebuild the Add-In project

	- now copy files from \debug to C:\4_PowerNC-Demo\PPNC16_HMI_Router\PPNC_Router_Addin
		- this is sub-dir under NC16 dir for distribution
		- files to copy over: DeviceMembers.xml, PPNC_Router_Addin.dll, PPNC_Router_Addin.pdb
		- add version.txt file to this directory as well

	- edit the PowerPmacNC.ini file in the working dir so it includes the new Add-In
		- see PowerPmacNC.ini.mike for example of ini file with this added
		- add below lines to section after 
			[External Assemblies]
			.... existing code
			.... new code at end of this section to add

			; Router_Addin Running on Target
			CustomTab="PPNC_Router_Addin\PPNC_Router_Addin.dll;PPNC_Router_Addin.PageCustomTab1"
			Object="PPNC_Router_Addin\PPNC_Router_Addin.dll;PPNC_Router_Addin.CustomObject"
			CodeGroups="PPNC_Router_Addin\PPNC_Router_Addin.dll;PPNC_Router_Addin.CustomCodeGroups"

			[Router_Addin]
			;example path = "C:\Outfile\"
			OutfilePath="C:\Outfile\"
			OutfileName="Outfile.csv"
			MachineName="DDS-Router"
			;typical delimiter either comma: ","  space: " "
			OutfileDelimiter=","
			AvgFeedrateEnable="1"
			AvgOverideEnable="1"

	-Now you should run the PowerPmacNC.exe from working dir
		- note the Router tab on Main page, chk version number
		- note the CNC Router section in Machine view


		-NOTE when updating Production Dir be careful to keep existing settings files for this machine !
			PowerPmacNC.ini				-custom setup to run HMI on this machine
			Messages.xml				-custom messages used by this application
			PowerPmacNC_Settings.xml	-here are machine settings setup in machine view, also stuff like work offsets


*********** End Dev Notes, now new version is ready to deploy **********


*** INI File Setup for NC
-add ref to external add-in project for HMI to load on startup
-below for Runtime we point to it's local dir for copy of add-in dll
-but for DEV so can work with ongoing changes and compiled code we point to the
	working dir of the add-in project, so it will load last compiled version of Add-in
	-for this the source does not need the \Add-in\ dir located under it's debug dir

*** INI settings for Router Addin application
sevaral INI settings are used to allow user to field modify some settings
-such as parameters related to the Outfile processing
-these are all in the Main NC14 INI file "PowerPmacNC.ini"
-these are all in section of that INI [Router_Addin]
-here is typical example of section to add to the INI file for this
	[Router_Addin]
	;example path = "C:\Outfile\"
	OutfilePath="C:\Outfile\"
	OutfileName="Outfile.csv"
	MachineName="DDS-Router"
	;typical delimiter either comma: ","  space: " "
	OutfileDelimiter=","
	AvgFeedrateEnable="1"
	AvgOverideEnable="1"


*************** PAST NOTES on Development *******************
*** DEV Notes:
	-the Addin must have References to:
		-these are found in the latest build of the NC14 HMI
			MCFoundation
			PowerPmacNC

		-here is HOW I do it... several ways possible
			-I build with latest NC14, then copy from NC14 project to PPNC_Router_Addin Project.. Addin\References dir:
				\PowerPmacNC\References\MCFoundation.dll
				\PowerPmacNC\bin\Debug\PowerPmacNC.exe
					-I rename the PowerPmacNC.exe to denote the actual Git Version it is
					so e.g.  PowerPmacNC.exe is renamed to PowerPmacNC-e2eaf23.exe   (Git version e2eaf23 of NC14 HMI)
		-Now in Addin project add a reference to each of these files under References
				-now you should see in References:   MCFoundation  AND   PowerPMACNC-e2eaf23
				-now project will build without any errors
		-NOTE about the References:
			-if major changes are made to MCF or the NC14 HMI you may need to get new versions of these files
			and update the references to these


	-how to work with Project in a DEBUG fashion for development:
		-Open current working NC14 HMI Internal or SDK that you are doing Dev with

		-In this Solution you want to ADD the  PPNC_Router_Addin Project to the Solution List
			-Rt-Clk Solution - Add - Existing Project - go to your Addin project dir and select the "PPNC_Router_Addin.csproj" file
			-now the Addin project should be in the Solution along with the NC14 HMI

		-Now in the NC14 HMI Debug dir (where it will run from when debugging) edit the INI file so it loads the External Assemblies for 
			your Addin project - see the INI setup below for details
			-add the ref to external add-in to load on startup
			-optionally add the other INI settings for router add-in to work with them as well
				-these are simply a new section added to ini [Router_Addin]

		-Now when NC14 is Run from VS in Debug it will ALSO run your Addin and you can debug BOTH while testing
			-as you make changes to Addin logic, rebuild and run NC14 to see/debug it 

		-NOTE when updating Production Dir be careful to keep existing settings files for this machine !
			PowerPmacNC.ini				-custom setup to run HMI on this machine
			Messages.xml				-custom messages used by this application
			PowerPmacNC_Settings.xml	-here are machine settings setup in machine view, also stuff like work offsets



	*** What I Do to create a new Version:
		-Got new PPNC version from Git (92c5db3)
		-Started VS for this Project:
			-Deleted the "..Router-Addin.." from the Solution
			-Rebuild All
			-Add "PPNC_Router_Addin" to  solution
		-Now in Addin Project:
			-modidfy the version to 0.20 
				-see ttbVersion.Text in PageCustomTab1.xaml.cs
				-note this is not the xaml file ...
				    ttbVersion.Text = "PPNC_Router_Addin v0.30";
			-update the References:
				-working in "C:\VS_2013\PPNC_Router_Addin\PPNC_Router_Addin\References"
				-be sure have backup of last working ref files
				-copy from PPNC14 \bin\Debug needed ref files 
					-copy from "C:\VS_2013\PowerPmacNc14-Internal-051915-92c5db3\PowerPmacNC\bin\Debug"
					-MCFoundation.dll
					-PowerPmacNC.exe
			-rename PowerPmacNC.exe  TO  PowerPmacNC-92c5db3.exe
			-goto Addin project References list
				-remove old PowerPmacNC-xxx.exe
				-add new PowerPmacNC-92c5db3.exe to ref list
		-Now Rebuild whole Solution
			-it will create new files for PPNC in  "C:\VS_2013\PowerPmacNc14-Internal-051915-92c5db3\PowerPmacNC\bin\Debug"
			-it will create new files for Addin in "C:\VS_2013\PPNC_Router_Addin\PPNC_Router_Addin\bin\Debug"

		-Update the Version txt file that will go with addin files

		-Be sure to include fix for mystery message if using a new version of HMI code, this is in by default had has to be done 
			each time you work with updated version of the HMI code
				- you have to get this message out of the Internal version and make sure all out of Add_In
				-fix for "mystery message" popping up when Axes Display mode changed
			e.g.  "Axes Display has been changed from Relative Position to Machine Position"
			-this is fixed by commenting out lines in function "AxesDisplay_ChangedAsString()" in
			Project CustomExamples - CustomObject.cs file
			-it is to demo how main HMI can link and make calls to custom projects in this case when the
				Axes display changes this gets called
			-we here comment out to prevent this message from coming up in our production HMI on router

		-resolve conflict with new HMI version, it is using M41 and so is Router Addin
			-it is using .M41 for "Gear Range M-code group"
			-edit the PowerPmacNC project file "MCodes.cs" to comment out "public enum EGearRangeGroup" section and
				comment out ref to .M41 in "public MCodes(FObject Owner, FDevice Controller)" functions



		-Now to create new version for production PC:
			-copy files from PPNC HMI \bin\debug to production dir for application
			-copy files from Addin \bin\debug to production dir "...\PPNC_Router_Addin\"
				-files to copy:
					DeviceMembers.xml
					PPNC_Router_Addin.dll
					PPNC_Router_Addin.pdb
					PPNC_Router_Addin_Version.txt

				-DO NOT Copy to runtime dir. these not needed:
					MCFoundatin.dll
					PowerPmacNC-xxxxxxx.exe

		-Now can run new version from Production Dir

		-NOTE when updating Production Dir be careful to keep existing settings files for this machine !
			PowerPmacNC.ini				-custom setup to run HMI on this machine
			Messages.xml				-custom messages used by this application
			PowerPmacNC_Settings.xml	-here are machine settings setup in machine view, also stuff like work offsets
